Difference between package type :
"type": "module", : import something , use es module
or common js
common js  : const js  require
nodemon : to not run server again and again
concurrenlty to run all the proces togetheer

proxy to connect at this point either from vite : or from package in client
How It Works
Client Request: When the React app running on http://localhost:3000 makes a request to /api/data, Vite intercepts this request.
Proxy Handling: Vite forwards the request to the Node.js server running on http://localhost:3001 due to the proxy configuration.
Server Response: The Node.js server processes the request and sends the response back.
Proxy Response: Vite receives the response from the Node.js server and forwards it back to the React app.
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:3001',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
      },
    },

    or in package js in client looks product order in this domain in dev

    "proxy" : "http://localhost:5000 "
