Difference between package type :
"type": "module", : import something , use es module
or common js
common js  : const js  require
nodemon : to not run server again and again
concurrenlty to run all the proces togetheer

proxy to connect at this point either from vite : or from package in client
How It Works
Client Request: When the React app running on http://localhost:3000 makes a request to /api/data, Vite intercepts this request.
Proxy Handling: Vite forwards the request to the Node.js server running on http://localhost:3001 due to the proxy configuration.
Server Response: The Node.js server processes the request and sends the response back.
Proxy Response: Vite receives the response from the Node.js server and forwards it back to the React app.
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:3001',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
      },
    },

    or in package js in client looks product order in this domain in dev

    "proxy" : "http://localhost:5000 "

    Understanding Proxy Options
changeOrigin: true:

This option changes the origin of the host header to the target URL.
It's useful when the backend server expects requests to come from a specific origin.
In some cases, it can cause issues if the backend server isn't set up to handle requests from different origins or if it's not necessary for your setup.
rewrite:

This option allows you to rewrite the URL path before forwarding the request to the target.
It's useful when your backend API doesnâ€™t use the same path structure as your front-end requests.
If your API and front-end paths already match, this might not be needed and can cause issues if not set correctly.
